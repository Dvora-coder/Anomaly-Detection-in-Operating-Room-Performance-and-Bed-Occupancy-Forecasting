        "# Operating Room Utilization Rate Calculation for 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we calculate the daily operating room utilization rate during 2024 using the cleaned Assuta Ramat HaHayal dataset. Our objective is to produce a key performance indicator that reflects how effectively scheduled and unscheduled procedure hours occupy the total available block time, thereby supporting capacity planning, efficiency analysis, and year-over-year comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Imports and Data Loading**  \n",
        "- We import essential libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`, etc.).  \n",
        "- We load the pre-cleaned 2024 Excel file into a pandas DataFrame and inspect its head, schema, and basic summary statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Initial Inspection and Copy**  \n",
        "- We examine the DataFrame’s structure, column names, and data types to ensure correct parsing.  \n",
        "- We create a working copy (`df_copy`) to preserve the original raw data for reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Removal of Irrelevant Records**  \n",
        "- We filter out any “No Show” entries and drop fully duplicated rows to avoid inflating utilization calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Date and Time Parsing**  \n",
        "- We convert planned block dates and actual entry/exit dates into proper `datetime` objects.  \n",
        "- We parse time-only fields (planned start/end, incision, closure, actual entry/exit) into `datetime.time` or `timedelta`, handling invalid or missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Timestamp Construction**  \n",
        "- We merge each planned date with its corresponding planned start and end times to form unified `Planned Start DateTime` and `Planned End DateTime` columns, enabling precise duration computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Service Hours (SH) Calculation**  \n",
        "- We compute each block's available hours as the difference between planned end and start datetimes, converted to hours.  \n",
        "- We group by operating room and date, take the maximum block hours per room per day, and sum these to obtain total service hours (`SH_r_hours`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Scheduled and Unscheduled Procedure Hours**  \n",
        "- **Scheduled Procedure Hours (SP):** We limit actual surgery durations to within each block window, convert to hours, and aggregate per room per day into `total_SP_per_day_room`.  \n",
        "- **Unscheduled Procedure Hours (SU):** We calculate any additional time used before incision or after closure but still within the block window, convert to hours, and aggregate per room per day into `SU_p_limited_hours`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. Utilization Rate Calculation**  \n",
        "- We define the daily utilization rate as:  \n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  daily_utilization_rate = (total_SP_per_day_room + SU_p_limited_hours) / SH_r_hours * 100\n",
        "We assign NaN for days or rooms with zero or missing service hours to prevent invalid ratios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. Merging Results and Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "We merge the calculated daily_utilization_rate back onto the main DataFrame by block date and operating room number.\n",
        "\n",
        "We compute summary statistics and generate distribution plots for both SH_r_hours and daily_utilization_rate to analyze efficiency patterns across 2024.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. Export**\n",
        "\n",
        "We save the enriched dataset, including the new utilization metric, to an Excel file for downstream analysis, visualization, and strategic decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these steps, we produce a robust utilization metric for each operating room in 2024, enabling in-depth capacity assessments, identification of under- or over-utilized periods, and informed resource allocation."
