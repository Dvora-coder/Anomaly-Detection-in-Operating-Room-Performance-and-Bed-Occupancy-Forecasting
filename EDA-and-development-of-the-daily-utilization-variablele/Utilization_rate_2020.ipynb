        "# Operating Room Utilization Rate Calculation for 2020\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we calculate the daily operating room utilization rate during 2020 using the cleaned Assuta Ramat HaHayal dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Imports and Data Loading**  \n",
        "- We import essential libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`, etc.) and load the pre-cleaned Excel file (`2020_data_Assuta_nomissings_for_stat_final_1005.xlsx`) into a DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Initial Inspection and Copy**  \n",
        "- We inspect the first rows, columns, and data types to verify correct parsing.  \n",
        "- We create a working copy (`df_copy`) to preserve the original raw data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Time and Date Conversion**  \n",
        "- We convert all relevant time-only columns (planned block times, incision, closure, actual entry/exit) first to `datetime.time` or `timedelta`, then to full `datetime` where appropriate.  \n",
        "- We convert key date columns (e.g., actual room entry date, planned block dates) to `datetime` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Conflict Detection and Resolution**  \n",
        "- We define and apply a function to detect internal chronological conflicts within each record (e.g., exit before incision) and correct or remove inconsistent entries.  \n",
        "- We log the number of internal and external corrections and review any deleted records.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Timestamp Construction**  \n",
        "- We merge each planned date with its corresponding planned start and end time to form unified `Planned Start DateTime` and `Planned End DateTime` columns, enabling accurate duration calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Feature Engineering for Utilization Components**  \n",
        "- **Service Hours (SH):** We compute each block's duration (`Planned End DateTime - Planned Start DateTime`) in hours, group by surgeon, date, and room to extract the maximum block hours per room per day, and sum these to obtain `SH_r_hours`.  \n",
        "- **Scheduled Procedure Hours (SP):** We calculate limited scheduled surgery durations within each block window, convert to hours, and aggregate per room per day into `total_SP_per_day_room`.  \n",
        "- **Unscheduled Procedure Hours (SU):** We compute any additional time used before incision or after closure but within the block window, convert to hours, and aggregate per room per day into `SU_p_limited_hours`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Utilization Rate Calculation**  \n",
        "- We calculate the daily utilization rate as:  \n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  daily_utilization_rate = (total_SP_per_day_room + SU_p_limited_hours) / SH_r_hours * 100\n",
        "We assign NaN for days or rooms with zero or missing service hours to avoid invalid ratios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. Merging and Formatting**\n",
        "\n",
        "We merge the calculated daily_utilization_rate back onto the main DataFrame by block date and operating room number.\n",
        "\n",
        "We format all time-based columns as HH:MM:SS strings for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. Export**\n",
        "\n",
        "We save the enriched dataset, including the new utilization metric, to 2020_data_with_UTR.xlsx for downstream analysis and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these steps, we enrich the 2020 surgical dataset with a robust utilization metric, enabling year-over-year comparisons, identification of under- or over-utilized periods, and informed resource-allocation decisions."
