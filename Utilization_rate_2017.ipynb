{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Operating Room Utilization Rate Calculation for 2017\n","\n","In this notebook, we calculate the daily operating room utilization rate for each theatre using the cleaned 2017 dataset from Assuta Ramat HaHayal. Our aim is to quantify how effectively scheduled and unscheduled procedure hours fill the total available block time, providing a key performance indicator for capacity planning and efficiency analysis.\n","\n","**1. Imports and Data Loading**  \n","- We import essential libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, and relevant statistical functions).  \n","- We load the pre-cleaned Excel file (`2017_data_Assuta_nomissings_for_stat_final_1105.xlsx`) into a pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","**2. Initial Inspection and Copy**  \n","- We review the first rows, column names, and data types to confirm correct parsing.  \n","- We create a working copy of the DataFrame (`df_copy`) to ensure the original remains intact.\n","\n","**3. Data Cleaning and Timestamp Construction**  \n","- We remove “No Show” records that should not contribute to utilization metrics.  \n","- We convert separate date and time columns (planned start/end, incision, closure) into full `datetime` objects and merge them into unified timestamp fields.\n","\n","**4. Feature Engineering**  \n","- **Block Duration (SH)**: We compute each block's total available hours (`SH_r_hours`) from planned start to planned end.  \n","- **Scheduled Procedure Hours (SP)**: We calculate the limited scheduled service hours per case and aggregate by room and date (`total_SP_per_day_room`).  \n","- **Unscheduled Procedure Hours (SU)**: We compute limited unscheduled hours per case and aggregate by room and date (`SU_p_limited_hours`).\n","\n","**5. Utilization Rate Calculation**  \n","- We define the daily utilization rate as:  \n","  ```python\n","  daily_utilization_rate = (total_SP_per_day_room + SU_p_limited_hours) / SH_r_hours * 100\n","\n","We assign NaN for any days or rooms with zero or missing service hours to avoid division errors.\n","\n","**6. Merging and Summary Statistics**\n","We merge the calculated daily_utilization_rate back onto the main DataFrame by block date and operating room number.\n","\n","We generate summary statistics and distribution charts for SH_r_hours and daily_utilization_rate to inspect room efficiency across the year.\n","\n","By following these steps, we enrich the 2017 dataset with a robust utilization metric that will support deeper analysis of operating room performance, identify under- or over-utilized days, and guide future capacity-planning decisions."],"metadata":{"id":"hPQ-H0dsVx3J"},"id":"hPQ-H0dsVx3J"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"87882ba5","metadata":{"id":"87882ba5"},"source":["Calculating the target variable - utilization
